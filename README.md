This project provides a practical example of how to conduct data analysis, visualization and model building in Python.
Feel free to explore the code and modify it as needed for your specific analysis or research purposes.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition at VF Motors. The goal is to understand the factors influencing employees' leaving situations and build models to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data manipulation, and the creation of predictive models using machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook or using the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Scikit-learn)


## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data manipulation and preprocessing for model building.
- Building predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Handling outliers and duplicate data for cleaner analysis.
- Visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.
